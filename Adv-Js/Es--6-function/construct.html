The function statement is not the only way to define a new function; 
you can define your function dynamically using Function() constructor 
along with the new operator.

Note âˆ’ Constructor is a terminology from Object Oriented Programming. 
You may not feel comfortable for the first time, which is OK.

Syntax

Following is the syntax to create a function using Function( ) 
constructor along with the new operator.

  var variablename = new Function(Arg1, Arg2..., "Function Body");
  
-->

<script>
	/*
	function sum(a,b,c)
	{
		document.write(a+b+c);
	}
	sum(5,5,5);
	*/
	var sum= new Function("a","b","c","d","document.write(a+b+c+d)");		
	sum(5,8,9,7);
